        <h2>Welcome to Shift Scheduler</h2>
        <p>
          Shift Scheduler is an Android-based mobile application that has been
          developed to simplify and make the process of tracking employees'
          shifts easier in small to medium workplaces. Intuitive indigo-texts
          and a user-friendly interface will help managers organize their work
          schedules effectively while incorporating the availability of each
          employee. This promotes collaboration, reduces conflict, and increases
          office productivity overall.

        <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Shift Scheduler is being used for creating shifts at the workplaces in
          the organizations that will be adaptable to the availability of the
          employees. It is a mobile application, and therefore, greater
          cooperation and productivity can be expected from the side of
          employees. The scheduling system is very simple.

        <h2>Post-mortem of the Shift Scheduler Development Experience</h2>
        <p>
          This has been quite an interesting journey into developing
          “ShiftScheduler”. Every other project had many issues besides the
          great successes. The following is a post-mortem describing the
          development experience we had with the project, along with some key
          aspects and reflections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall Architecture The architecture of our system was generally
          designed in three tiers as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Persistence Layer:</span> It included the
            database and data access objects (DAOs) responsible for storing and
            retrieving our data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Logic Layer:</span> This layer contained all
            business logic: the scheduling algorithm, user authentication, and
            the notification system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Presentation Layer: </span> It was developed by
            means of Android layouts and activities to help users interact with
            the application.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This architecture clearly separated concerns, making the system much
          easier to manage and scale.
        </p>

        <h2>What Went Right</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Successful Final Product:</span> We are proud
            that we were able to deliver a fully functional product that met the
            initial requirements and user stories. The app includes all the
            indigo-texts that were supposed to be implemented, such as employee
            management, shift scheduling, and availability submission.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Team Collaboration: </span> Our team, with a few
            hitches on the way, has been very collaborative. We did hold two
            meetings every week and kept each other updated. We used version
            control effectively for the smooth management of our codebase.
          </li>

      <section id="contact" class="content">
        <h2>What Went Wrong</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Communication Issues:</span> At certain points
            during the development process, we faced communication challenges.
            Most of the delays occurred due to misunderstandings during the task
            assignments and indigo-text implementations. However, we were able
            to adapt to it with more appropriate channels of communication and
            by checking in more often.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Initial Planning vs. Execution:</span> We spent
            quite some time in the planning stage, which delayed us from the
            beginning of actual development work. As a result, plenty of
            unpredicted problems started to emerge at the latest stage of the
            process. We could have found and fixed those problems way earlier if
            we had started writing code upfront.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Areas for Improvement In our iteration 2 retrospective, we agreed that
          we needed to do a better job of visualization and prototyping of
          indigo-texts. It was very important so that everyone on the team knew
          what they were going to build. We did manage to get through this quite
          a lot of the time, but it stayed our pain point all through the
          project.

        <h2>What Went Wrong</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Project Scope:</span> The estimated scope of the
            project was about 25 classes designed in four iterations. Every
            iteration was used to trim indigo-texts and bugs after taking user
            reviews into account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Time Spent:</span> The most time-consuming
            activity was visualizing indigo-texts during iteration 0 and 1.
            Because defining the application requirements and user interaction
            had to be made clear.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Design Decisions:</span> To meet our promise of
            standard design patterns and programming practices for scalability
            and maintainability, we resolved to apply the MVC architecture to
            the web frontend.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          All in all, the building of “ShiftScheduler” has been a very
          productive experience. During the journey, we learned a lot about
          teamwork, the development of large projects, and the importance of
          communication and planning.
        </p>
        <p>For the future:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Start:</span> Earlier in the lifecycle of your
            project. Code to find potential issues early.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Keep:</span> The team in sync. Update regularly
            and communicate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Don't:</span> Overemphasize the importance of the
            planning phase.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This project enforced in our minds the idea that effective teamwork
          could lead to the creation of a product far beyond what any one
          individual could have achieved on their own.
