**Shift Scheduler Vision Statement**

**Vision Statement:**
Shift Scheduler will be used to generate the shift layouts for managers, taking into account the availability of the employees. It's a simple and comprehensive mobile app, that will bring more collaboration and productivity from employees through a very intuitive scheduling system.

**Project Description:**
The Android app, Shift Scheduler, is designed to support workplaces in managing shifts within their premises. The app will support employee scheduling and communication through features like employee caching, monthly work statistics, and an advanced scheduling algorithm. A manager can do so by maintaining an updated staff list, an individual employee availability, as well as the assigned shifts. The app also makes sure the assigned shifts match each employee’s availability to prevent no-shows or inconvenience.
Shift Scheduler’s “week at a glance” view ensures that a manager or an employee easily sees scheduled shifts and avoids employee’s showing up for shifts they weren’t assigned to. Furthermore, the app notifies its users of upcoming shifts and schedule changes to make sure they are well prepared or to seek adjustment ahead of time. Shift Scheduler also allows users to trade shifts and hereby increases workplace flexibility, cooperation between employees, as well as teamwork.

**Target audience:**
Shift Scheduler is an app that is designed primarily for use by small and medium-sized workplaces of different fields such as retail. The app will mainly be used by managers and employees for viewing and managing their work schedules.

**Project Value:**
As a team, we expect Shift Scheduler to bring value into every workplace where it is used by simply saving time and reducing efforts. The application is created with a variety of tools that are powerful and timesaving for easy scheduling, making adjustments, tracking employee resource availability, as well as planning shift coverage. This will allow proper assignment of resources and allow for both the managers and employees to be more productive. The application also empowers employees by giving them more control over their work-life balance.

**Success Criteria:**
The app will be considered successful if workplaces and managers continue to use Shift Scheduler over any previously used shift scheduling techniques or services. An acceptable success ratio would be around 50% - 60% of every workplace that gets to try the app and decides to fully incorporate it within their usual shift scheduling procedure.
